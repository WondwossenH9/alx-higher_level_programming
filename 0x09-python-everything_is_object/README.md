0x09-python-everything_is_object
In this project I learned about objects and values, aliasing, immutable vs mutable types,
mutaion, cloning lists and python tuples.
Task 0: "Who am i?", is about what function would I use to get the type of an object.
Task 1: "Where are you?", is about how to get the variable identifier.
Task 2 to 5: "Right count", are about if the given two variables point to the same object.
Tasks 6 to 13: are about what the given code prints
Tasks 14 to 18: are about what the given script prints
Task 19: is about writing a function def copy_list(l): that returns a copy of a list.      
Task 20 to 23: are about identifying if the given variable is a tuple or not.
Task 24 to 28: are about waht the given script prints.
Advanced tasks:
Task 29: Write a function magic_string() that returns a string “BestSchool” n times the number of the iteration.
Task 30: Write a class LockedClass with no class or object attribute, that prevents the user from dynamically
	creating new instance attributes, except if the new instance attribute is called first_name.
Task 31 to 36: is about how many int objects are created by the execution of the given script.
