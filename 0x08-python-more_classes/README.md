0x08. Python - More Classes and Object
This project introduced me to Object Oriented Programming.
I learnt about Class and Instance Attributes, class methods and static methods,
properties, getters and setters and also str vs repr.
The tasks done in this project are:
Task0: Simple rectangle which is to write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle
Task1: Real definition of a rectangle which is to write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 0-rectangle.py)
Task2: Area and perimeter whih is to Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 1-rectangle.py)
Task3: String representation which is to Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 2-rectangle.py)
Task4: Eval is magic which is to Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 3-rectangle.py)
Task5: Detect instance deletion which is to write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 4-rectangle.py)
Task6: How many instances is to Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 5-rectangle.py)
Task7: Change representation is to Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 6-rectangle.py)
Task8: Compare rectangles is to Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 7-rectangle.py)
Task9: A square is a rectangle is to Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 8-rectangle.py)
Task10(Advanced task): is about N queens puzzle whih is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. 
	This task is to Write a program that solves the N queens problem.
